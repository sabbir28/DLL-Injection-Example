# DLL Injection Example

This repository contains an educational example of **DLL injection** techniques written in **C++**. The code demonstrates how DLL injection works at a basic level, focusing on educational and ethical purposes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**
This code is provided for **educational purposes only**. **I do not promote any illegal activities**, and it is important to understand the ethical and legal implications of DLL injection. Always follow the terms of service for software you interact with and ensure you have permission before modifying or interacting with any applications.

## üîß **Requirements**
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., Visual Studio, GCC)
- Basic understanding of **Windows programming**
- Knowledge of **C++** and **Windows API** (for understanding the code)
- **Administrator privileges** (may be required for injecting DLLs into running processes)

## üì¶ **Installation & Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sabbir28/DLL-Injection-Example.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any C++ IDE.
3. Build the project to compile the DLL.
4. Inject the compiled DLL into the target application using an appropriate injector (the technique is explained in the related video).

## üìπ **Video Tutorial**
If you are unfamiliar with DLL injection, check out my YouTube video where I explain how it works in more detail:

## üîë **Ethical Considerations**
Use this code at your own risk. Always get permission before injecting any DLL into a program or modifying software you don't own. This is **not** a tool for cheating or illegal activities.
